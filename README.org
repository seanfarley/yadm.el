#+title: yadm.el
#+author: Sean Farley

=yadm.el= adds Emacs functionality to work with your [[https://yadm.io][yadm]] dotfiles. This package
adds support for many packages ([[Http://magit.vc][Magit,]] [[https://projectile.mx][Projectile]], etc) by testing
=default-directory= for being the user's home directory.

* Usage
Open your =yadm= dotfiles files simply by opening =~/=. You can add this to your
known projects for convenience,

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(add-to-list 'projectile-known-projects "~/")
#+end_src

* Backstory

This project is a second attempt at getting yadm to work within the ecosystem of
Emacs. Previously, it was implemented on top of [[http://www.gnu.org/software/tramp/][Tramp]] but that exposed many
problems due to Tramp not being re-entrant. Running things like linting,
spellcheck, magit, etc would lead to errors within Emacs.

This package instead advises functions so that we can check if we're in the home
directory or not.
